PROBLEM 1
Probability of proposition p= 0.551
Probability of not getting proposition q= 1-0.551 = 0.449
Using binomial distribution 
The probability that exactly two vote for proposition is P(x=2) = 6c2(0.5512)(0.449(6-2)) = 0.185
18.5% of chance that exactly two vote for the proposition

PROBLEM 2
marks are 20	15	26	32	18	28	35 14	26	22 17
Mean= (20+15+26+32+18+28+35+14+26+22+17)/11 =23
error sqr  9 64 9 81 25 25 144 81 9 1 36
Standerd deviation= 6.6
sqr	Standardized score
=((marks-mean)/standerd deviation)
-0.45	-1.21	0.45	1.36	-0.76	0.76	1.82	-1.36	0.45	-0.15	-0.9
Only two students who scored 15 and 14 fail the test as their score is less than -1
